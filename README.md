# Image-Classification-Using-SVM
Here I attempt an image classification for the infamous dogs vs cats dataset using SVM as an approach. Lets see if I pass or fail!

Download the dataset from the link given below :

https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data


Steps to follow :

>Start by importing the required libraries.
>
>Preprocess and augment the data.
>
>Now read the data into training and test datasets.
>
>Now its time for CCFE(create, compile, fit and evaluate) our model.

>Check the model accuracies and losses by plotting it.

>Save the model
>
>Load the model
>
>Now test on a single prediction as a test
>
>Do this by converting the image into vector by passing it as an array and putting it up for comparison.
